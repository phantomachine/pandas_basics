    "You are an economist working at a global business headquartered in Singapore. In 2015 your company were looking to expand its operations to the UK but have held off in light of Brexit. You are asked to provide a briefing about what the current data tells us about foreign investment in the UK. Include theory of why this might be the case and what this tells us about the UK economy. \n"

    "In June 2016 the UK voted to leave the European Union and on 31st January 2020 the UK officially left the EU. This change is likely to become one of the most important UK economic policy changes for decades, but how will this affect those thinking of investing into the UK? \n",

    "Most anaylses carried out by economists before the referendum indicated that leaving the EU would have negative short and long-run consequences for a range of economic indicators, including inflation, foreign direct investment, and per capita income. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the status quo of the trading relationship between the UK and EU remains during the transition period, anecdotal evidence suggests the uncertainty over Britain's trading relationship with the EU is damaging the Britain’s attractiveness as a destination for inward investment. \n",
