    "You are an economics consultant and have been approached by an ecommerce business who are looking to expand the products available on their platform. They would like you to provide an analysis of popular items for UK consumers and their corresponding price trends. As an online site they might also want to know about regional differences and how that might inform their firm's pricing decisions. "

    "The price data come from monthly records of prices known as ‘price quotes’ that are recorded by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The price quotes files contain information on the item sold, its location, the shop and shop type (the size of the establishment) it is sold in, and whether it was offered at a sale or regular price. In the past year the ONS have also begun collecting prices from online retailers. The final raw data has over 32m observations. The dataset you will be using is not the original ONS price quotes data (which is available [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceindicescpiandretailpricesindexrpiitemindicesandpricequotes)) but a smaller, cleaner sample with fewer basket items available to download from her. \n",
